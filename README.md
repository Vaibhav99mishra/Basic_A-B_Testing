# A/B Testing Web Application
This is a simple Flask application that performs an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of two different landing page versions, Version A and Version B. This application randomly assigns users to one of the two versions and tracks conversions (sign-ups) for each version. The results can be viewed on a summary page.

# Features
Random assignment of users to either Version A or Version B of the landing page.
Tracking of sign-ups for each version.
Summary page to display conversion counts for both versions.
Integration with ngrok for easy sharing of the app when hosted locally.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
ngrok: Used to expose the local Flask app to the internet for testing.
